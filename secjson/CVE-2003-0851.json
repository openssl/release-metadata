On platforms such as Windows this large recursion cannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash. This could be performed for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured to accept them."
