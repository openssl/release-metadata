OpenSSL Security Advisory [29 October 2018]
===========================================

Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0735)
==================================================================

Severity: Low

The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a
timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing
algorithm to recover the private key.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release
of OpenSSL 1.1.1 or 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in
OpenSSL 1.1.1a and OpenSSL 1.1.0j when they become available. The fix
is also available in commit b1d6d55ece (for 1.1.1) and commit 56fb454d28
(for 1.1.0) in the OpenSSL git repository.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 25th October 2018 by Samuel Weiser.
