OpenSSL Security Advisory [12 Mar 2012]
=======================================

CMS and S/MIME Bleichenbacher attack (CVE-2012-0884)
====================================================

A weakness in the OpenSSL CMS and PKCS #7 code can be exploited
using Bleichenbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 RSA padding
also known as the million message attack (MMA).

Only users of CMS, PKCS #7, or S/MIME decryption operations are affected. A
successful attack needs on average 2^20 messages. In practice only automated
systems will be affected as humans will not be willing to process this many
messages.

SSL/TLS applications are *NOT* affected by this problem since the 
SSL/TLS code does not use the PKCS#7 or CMS decryption code. 

Thanks to Ivan Nestlerode <inestlerode@us.ibm.com> for discovering
this weakness.

The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.

Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.0h or 0.9.8u.
