OpenSSL Security Advisory [28-Mar-2008]

Two moderate severity security flaws have been fixed in OpenSSL
0.9.8h.  The OpenSSL security team would like to thank Codenomicon for
reporting these issues.


OpenSSL Server Name extension crash
-----------------------------------

Testing using the Codenomicon TLS test suite discovered a flaw in the
handling of server name extension data in OpenSSL 0.9.8f and OpenSSL
0.9.8g.  If OpenSSL has been compiled using the non-default TLS server
name extensions, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted
packet to a server application using OpenSSL and cause it to crash.
(CVE-2008-0891).

Please note this issue does not affect any other released versions of
OpenSSL, and does not affect versions compiled without TLS server name
extensions.

Users of OpenSSL 0.9.8f or 0.9.8g should update to the OpenSSL 0.9.8h
release which contains a patch to correct this issue.


OpenSSL Omit Server Key Exchange message crash
----------------------------------------------

Testing using the Codenomicon TLS test suite discovered a flaw if the
'Server Key exchange message' is omitted from a TLS handshake in
OpenSSL 0.9.8f and OpenSSL 0.9.8g.  If a client connects to a
malicious server with particular cipher suites, the server could cause
the client to crash.  (CVE-2008-1672).

Please note this issue does not affect any other released versions of
OpenSSL.

Users of OpenSSL 0.9.8f or 0.9.8g should update to the OpenSSL 0.9.8h
release which contains a patch to correct this issue.
