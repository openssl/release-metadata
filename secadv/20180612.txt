OpenSSL Security Advisory [12 June 2018]
========================================

Client DoS due to large DH parameter (CVE-2018-0732)
====================================================

Severity: Low

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a
malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will
cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key
for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be
exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of
OpenSSL 1.1.0 or 1.0.2 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0i
and OpenSSL 1.0.2p when they become available. The fix is also available in
commit ea7abeeab (for 1.1.0) and commit 3984ef0b7 (for 1.0.2) in the OpenSSL git
repository.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 5th June 2018 by Guido Vranken who also
developed the fix.
