OpenSSL Security Advisory [01-Jun-2010]

Two security flaws have been fixed in OpenSSL 0.9.8o and OpenSSL 1.0.0a.

Invalid ASN1 module definition for CMS.
=======================================

CMS structures containing OriginatorInfo are mishandled this can write to
invalid memory addresses or free up memory twice
(CVE-2010-0742).

This bug is only present in the CMS code: the older PKCS#7 code is not affected.

CMS is only present in OpenSSL 0.9.8h and later where it is disabled by
default and 1.0.0 where it is enabled by default.

Users of OpenSSL CMS code should update to 0.9.8o or 1.0.0a which contains a
patch to correct this issue.

Thanks to Ronald Moesbergen for reporting this issue.

Invalid Return value check in pkey_rsa_verifyrecover
====================================================

When verification recovery fails for RSA keys an uninitialised buffer with an
undefined length is returned instead of an error code (CVE-2010-1633).

This bug is only present in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and only affects applications that
call the function EVP_PKEY_verify_recover(). As this function is not present
in previous versions of OpenSSL and not used by OpenSSL internal code very few
applications should be affected. The OpenSSL utility application "pkeyutl" does 
use this function.

Affected users should update to 1.0.0a which contains a patch to correct this
bug.

Thanks to Peter-Michael Hager for reporting this issue.
