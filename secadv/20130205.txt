OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 Feb 2013]
========================================

SSL, TLS and DTLS Plaintext Recovery Attack (CVE-2013-0169)
============================================================

Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson have discovered a weakness in the handling
of CBC ciphersuites in SSL, TLS and DTLS. Their attack exploits timing
differences arising during MAC processing. Details of this attack can be
found at: http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/

All versions of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1c, 1.0.0j and 0.9.8x

Note: this vulnerability is only partially mitigated when OpenSSL is used
in conjuction with the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module and the FIPS mode of
operation is enabled.

Thanks go to Nadhem J. AlFardan and Kenneth G. Paterson of the Information
Security Group Royal Holloway, University of London for discovering this flaw.

An initial fix was prepared by Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> and Emilia
KÃ¤sper <ekasper@google.com> of Google. Additional refinements were added by
Ben Laurie, Andy Polyakov and Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL group.

Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1e, 1.0.0k or 0.9.8y
(The fix in 1.0.1d wasn't complete, so please use 1.0.1e or later)

TLS 1.1 and 1.2 AES-NI crash (CVE-2012-2686)
=============================================

A flaw in the OpenSSL handling of CBC ciphersuites in TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on
AES-NI supporting platforms can be exploited in a DoS attack. If you are
unsure if you are using AES-NI see "References" below.

Anyone using an AES-NI platform for TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 on OpenSSL 1.0.1c is
affected. Platforms which do not support AES-NI or versions of OpenSSL which
do not implement TLS 1.2 or 1.1 (for example OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.0) are
not affected.

Thanks go to Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> for initially discovering the
bug and developing a fix and to Wolfgang Ettlingers
 <wolfgang.ettlinger@gmail.com> for independently discovering this issue.

Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1d

OCSP invalid key DoS issue (CVE-2013-0166)
============================================

A flaw in the OpenSSL handling of OCSP response verification can be exploitedin a denial of service attack.

All versions of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1c, 1.0.0j and 0.9.8x

This flaw was discovered and fixed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.

Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1d, 1.0.0k or 0.9.8y.
