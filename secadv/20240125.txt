OpenSSL Security Advisory [25th January 2024]
=============================================

PKCS12 Decoding crashes (CVE-2024-0727)
=======================================

Severity: Low

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()
and PKCS12_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

OpenSSL 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.1 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.5 once it is released.

OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.13 once it is released.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1x once it is released
(premium support customers only).

OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2zj once it is released
(premium support customers only).

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available. The fix is also available in commit 775acfdbd0 (for 3.2),
commit d135eeab8a (for 3.1) and commit 09df4395b5 (for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git
repository. It is available to premium support customers in commit
03b3941d60 (for 1.1.1) and in commit aebaa5883e (for 1.0.2).

This issue was reported on 23rd November 2023 by Bahaa Naamneh (Crosspoint
Labs). The fix was developed by Matt Caswell.
