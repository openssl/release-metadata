========================================

Malformed X.509 IPAddressFamily could cause OOB read (CVE-2017-3735)
===================================================================

Severity: Low

If an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension,
OpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread. The most likely result
would be an erroneous display of the certificate in text format.

This bug has been present since 2006.

OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0g
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2m

This issue was found by Google's OSS-Fuzz project on August 22.
The fix was developed by Rich Salz of the OpenSSL development team.

UPDATE 02 November 2017: At the time of the original security advisory the fix
was only available in the development versions. The advisory has now been
updated with the release information.
